## 🎓 Grading Policy

The final grade for the course is based on continuous assessment, a midterm examination, a final project, and a final exam.  
Grades follow the standard Russian 5-point system, where **5** = Excellent, **4** = Good, **3** = Satisfactory, and **2** = Fail.

### **Grade Components**

| **Component** | **Weight (%)** | **Description** |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Assignments (10 total)** | **40%** | Each lecture is followed by an assignment that includes practical exercises or short analytical questions. Assignments assess understanding of key concepts and implementation skills. |
| **Midterm Exam** | **15%** | Covers the first six lectures. Includes theoretical questions and one applied problem to assess both conceptual and mathematical understanding. |
| **Final Project** | **25%** | Students select a dataset and apply the complete machine learning pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. A short written report (5–10 pages) and code submission are required. |
| **Final Exam** | **20%** | A comprehensive examination covering all twelve lectures. Tests both theoretical knowledge and the ability to apply ML algorithms to practical problems. |

- Which task each team member do

### **Grade Conversion**

| **Total Score (%)** | **Final Grade (1–5)** | **Meaning** |
|----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **90–100** | **5 (Excellent)** | Deep understanding, complete and correct solutions, and high-quality project work. |
| **75–89** | **4 (Good)** | Good grasp of theory and practice, with minor inaccuracies. |
| **60–74** | **3 (Satisfactory)** | Basic understanding with partial or incomplete reasoning. |
| **Below 60** | **2 (Fail)** | Insufficient understanding or incomplete submission of required work. |

### **Notes**
- All assignments must be submitted before the respective deadlines to receive credit.  
- Late submissions may result in a deduction of up to 20% of the assignment grade.  
- Active participation and consistent engagement throughout the course are expected.  
- The final project must demonstrate an independent application of machine learning techniques and proper interpretation of results.


**Total:** 100 points → converted to the 5-point grading scale.
